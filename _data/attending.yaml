arriving-plane-title: Arriving by Plane 
arriving-plane: |
  When you arrive at either Melbourne Tullamarine Airport or Avalon Airport, you can either use a taxi or Uber to reach Melbourne CBD or the conference location. Taxi fares from Tullamarine Airport to Melbourne CBD are around AU$90.00, to Caulfield would be around AU$110.00.
  Another option is using SkyBus. This bus service operates from both Tullamarine Airport and Avalon Airport, stopping at Southern Cross Station in Melbourne CBD. From Southern Cross Station, you can easily travel onwards using public transport. SkyBus services run on the following schedule:
  • Tullamarine Airport: every 10 minutes, between 4:00 am and 1:00 am;
  • Avalon Airport: every arriving and departing flight. 
  In order to use SkyBus, you need to buy a ticket at the SkyBus Kiosk at the airport arrival hall, or online: <a href="https://www.skybus.com.au/buy-tickets/" style="color:#286090;" target="_blank">Buy Tickets.</a>

arriving-train-title: Using public transport
arriving-train: |
 In order to access public transport, you need a Myki card. With this prepaid card, you gain access to all trams, buses, and local trains. You can buy a Myki card at: 
 • All 7/11 shops;
 • All train stations
 • The Melbourne Airport Tullamarine Arrival Hall;
 • And many other shops.

 In order to use the Myki card, you need to top up. You can use credit cards, debit cards and cash to do so. Top up machines can be found at all train stations and all Myki outlets. The standard fare is AU$5.30 for 2 hours of travel, with a maximum daily fare of AU$10.60.  <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/myki/buy-a-myki-and-top-up/where-to-buy-and-top-up/" style="color:#286090;" target="_blank">More Info</a>.

 When using public transport, you always need to tap on and off with you Myki, unless: 
 • You are travelling by tram: then only tapping on is needed. 
 • You are travelling within the Free Tram Zone: no tapping on/off is needed here. The Free Tram Zone encapsulates most of Melbourne’s CBD area. The conference location is outside of the Free Tram Zone. For the map of the Free Tram Zone, see:  <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/assets/PTV-default-site/Maps-and-Timetables-PDFs/Maps/Network-maps/Free-Tram-Zone-Map-Map-2023.pdf" style="color:#286090;" target="_blank">Map</a>.

 For the most up to date information and to plan your travels, you can use Google Maps or the Public Transport Victoria (PTV) app:   <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/footer/about-ptv/digital-tools/mobile-apps/" style="color:#286090;" target="_blank">App</a>.
