ws1-title: "Secured Augmentation: On-Body Security and Safety Interfaces"
ws1-organizer1: Oliver Hein, Bundeswehr University Munich, Munich, Germany
ws1-organizer2: Alia Saad, University Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany
ws1-organizer3: Yomna Abdelrahman, Bundeswehr University Munich, Munich, Germany
ws1-organizer4: Florian Alt, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Munich, Germany
ws1-overview: With the rapid integration of wearable sensors and head-mounted displays (HMDs), ensuring security and safety in human-computer interaction has never been more critical. The On-Body Security and Safety Interfaces workshop explores the intersection of biometric authentication, safety- and privacy-preserving wearables, physiological sensing, and safety- and security-driven augmented interfaces.
  Key topics include novel authentication methods for wearable devices, privacy-preserving techniques for continuous physiological monitoring, secure interaction paradigms for AR and VR environments, and adaptive safety mechanisms that enhance user trust and system reliability. Through discussions and collaborative sessions, this workshop aims to foster new ideas and interdisciplinary approaches to ensuring secure, safe, and user-friendly on-body computing. We also invite participants to submit position papers via email to the organizers or bring hands-on demonstrations. By addressing both emerging challenges and future opportunities, this workshop seeks to pave the way for more resilient, privacy-conscious, and intelligent wearable and augmented systems that prioritize user well-being while maintaining seamless interaction experiences.

ws2-title: "Beyond Human: Cognitive and Physical Augmentation through AI, Robotics, and XR – Opportunities and Risks"
ws2-organizer1: JIE LI, Human, AI Symbiosis Alliance, The Netherlands
ws2-organizer2: ANUSHA WITHANA, University of Sydney, Australia
ws2-organizer3: ALEXANDRA DIENING, Human-AI Symbiosis Alliance, Switzerland
ws2-organizer4: KAI KUNZE, Keio University, Japan
ws2-organizer5: MASAHIKO INAMI, University of Tokyo, Japan
ws2-overview: As human augmentation technologies evolve, the convergence of AI, robotics, and extended reality (XR) is redefining human potential—enhancing cognition, perception, and physical abilities. However, these advancements also introduce ethical dilemmas, security risks, and concerns over loss of control. This workshop explores both the transformative potential and the unintended consequences of augmentation technologies. Bringing together experts from HCI, neuroscience, robotics, and ethics, we will examine real-world applications, emerging risks, and governance strategies for responsible augmentation.
  The workshop will feature keynote talks and interactive discussions, addressing topics such as AI-enhanced cognition, wearable robotics, neural interfaces, and XR-driven augmentation. By fostering multidisciplinary dialogue, this workshop aims to generate actionable insights for responsible innovation, proposing ethical frameworks to balance human empowerment with risk mitigation. We invite researchers, practitioners, and industry leaders to contribute their perspectives and help shape the future of human augmentation.
