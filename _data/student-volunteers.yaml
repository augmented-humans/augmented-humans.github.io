duties-title: Duties and Benefits
duties: Student volunteers will be required to help set up and perform a diverse variety of work during the conference, as needed. Duties will include bag stuffing, manning the registration desk, AV assistance, poster and demo setup, badge checking, break monitoring, etc. Volunteers will also need to be available during the conference if new tasks come up. (There will be approximately 16 scheduled work hours per student volunteer.)
  Student volunteers will usually be able to attend most of the conference sessions, even while working.
  In addition to the innate joys of performing the duties above, AH student volunteers will get in return an awesome AH 2025 SV t-shirt, free conference registration, including the meals provided by the conference registrations and most importantly, a chance to meet and network with established members in the community as well as your student peers.
