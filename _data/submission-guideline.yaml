instructions-title: Submission Guidelines
instructions: |
  
  <strong> * Submissions shall be made via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ahs2026">EasyChair</a>.</strong>

  <strong>The submission system will be opened by October 18th.</strong>

  <b>T</b>he <b>A</b>CM <b>P</b>ublication <b>S</b>ystem (TAPS) will be used for full papers, short papers, posters, and demos. Please be sure to read the instructions on the <a href="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow">TAPS workflow page</a> carefully.
  
  First, authors will prepare their manuscript using the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template"> ACM Primary Article Template</a> in single-column format for review. Upon conditional acceptance, the authors revise their manuscript to submit their publication-ready article. The ACM workflow requests authors to produce final publications (PDF and HTML5) by themselves using TAPS. For this, the authors upload publication-ready source files (single-column Word or double-column LaTeX) to TAPS. TAPS will then generate the double-column PDF and responsive HTML5 document. Further information and the templates for both Latex and Word can be found on the corresponding <a href="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-latex">Preparing Your Article with LaTeX</a> or <a href="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-microsoft-word">Preparing Your Article with Word</a> pages.

  <u>In short:</u> 
  •	Use the <b>single-column Word Submission Template</b> or the <b>single-column LaTeX Template</b> for submission. For LaTeX, you can use <tt>\documentclass[manuscript, review, anonymous]{acmart}</tt> to create an anonymous submission.
  •	Use the <b>single-column Word Submission Template</b> or the <b>double-column LaTeX Template</b> (i.e., <tt>\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}</tt>) for publication in the ACM Digital Library (i.e., after conditional acceptance).
  •	Follow the above linked tutorials for further information on how to work with the ACM Primary Article Template. 
  •	You can directly download the <a href="https://authors.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_submission_template.docx">Word Template</a> or the <a href="https://portalparts.acm.org/hippo/latex_templates/acmart-primary.zip"> LaTeX Template</a> if you wish.
