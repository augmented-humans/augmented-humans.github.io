  We have created a special track to facilitate the fast publication of papers that went through the CHI R&R process and were not accepted for the final proceedings.
  You can submit these papers via EasyChair using the Augmented Humans 2026 Special Fast Track CfP. The submission deadline for this track is 27th January 2026. Decision notifications will be sent by the 13th of February 2026, and authors must prepare a camera-ready version by the 27th of February 2026.
