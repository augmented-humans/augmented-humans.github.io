about-title: About the conference
about: |
  The Augmented Humans (AHs) International Conference 2023 will be an in-person event, held in March 2023. More information on the time schedule will be made available soon. 
  The conference focuses on physical, cognitive, and perceptual augmentation of humans through digital technologies. The plural – humans – emphasizes the move towards technologies that enhance human capabilities beyond the individual and will have the potential for impact on a societal scale.
  The idea of augmenting the human intellect has a long tradition, the term was coined by Douglas Engelbart in 1962<sup>[1]</sup>. Today, many of the technologies envisioned by Engelbart and other are commonplace, and looking towards the future, many technologies which amplify the human body and mind far beyond the original vision are within reach.
  The conference proceedings are planned to be published in the ACM Digital Library as a volume in its International Conference Proceedings Series with ISBN.

instructions-title: Submission Guidelines 
instructions: |
  Submissions can be made via <a href="https://easychair.org/cfp/ahs2023">EasyChair</a>.

  <b>T</b>he <b>A</b>CM <b>P</b>ublication <b>S</b>ystem (TAPS) will be used for full papers, short papers, posters, and demos. Please be sure to read the instructions on the <a href="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow">TAPS workflow page</a> carefully.
  
  First, authors will prepare their manuscript using the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template"> ACM Primary Article Template</a> in single-column format for review. Upon conditional acceptance, the authors revise their manuscript to submit their publication-ready article. The ACM workflow requests authors to produce final publications (PDF and HTML5) by themselves using TAPS. For this, the authors upload publication-ready source files (single-column Word or double-column LaTeX) to TAPS. TAPS will then generate the double-column PDF and responsive HTML5 document. Further information and the templates for both Latex and Word can be found on the corresponding <a href="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-latex">Preparing Your Article with LaTeX</a> or <a href="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-microsoft-word">Preparing Your Article with Word</a> pages.

  <u>In short:</u> 
  •	Use the <b>single-column Word Submission Template</b> or the <b>single-column LaTeX Template</b> for submission. For LaTeX, you can use <tt>\documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart}</tt> to create an anonymous submission.
  •	Use the <b>single-column Word Submission Template</b> or the <b>double-column LaTeX Template</b> (i.e., <tt>\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}</tt>) for publication in the ACM Digital Library (i.e., after conditional acceptance).
  •	Follow the above linked tutorials for further information on how to work with the ACM Primary Article Template. 
  •	You can directly download the <a href="https://authors.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_submission_template.docx">Word Template</a> or the <a href="https://portalparts.acm.org/hippo/latex_templates/acmart-primary.zip"> LaTeX Template</a> if you wish. Alternatively, you can also use <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-primary-article-template/wbvnghjbzwpc"> this Overleaf template</a>.
