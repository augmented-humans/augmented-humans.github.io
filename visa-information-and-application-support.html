          <h3>Visa Requirements</h3>
          <p>If you are a national of certain countries, you may be required to obtain a visa to enter Japan. To check whether a visa is necessary for your entry, please refer to the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan:
          <a href="https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html</a>. You may consult your local travel agency or contact the nearest Japanese Embassy or Consulate-General for accurate, up-to-date guidance.</p>
          <p>AHs2026 will issue an invitation letter required for visa application free of charge only to participants who have completed both registration and payment. If you require an invitation letter along with other supporting documents (for a short-term business visa), a processing fee of 20,000 JPY will be charged.</p>

          <h3>Short-Term Business Visa</h3>
          <p>Suppose you require a short-term business visa to attend the conference. In that case, the organizing committee will issue an official invitation letter in English and supporting documents in Japanese for your visa application, once your registration is complete and you have submitted the visa questionnaire.</p>

          <h3>Visa Application Support - Steps to Follow</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Complete your registration and payment for the conference.</li>
            <li>After registration, we will send you the Visa Questionnaire by email.</li>
            <li>Submit the Visa Questionnaire with all required details. This step is essential to ensure we prepare the correct documents tailored to your visa needs.</li>
            <li>Once your request is processed, you will receive the invitation letter and visa application support documents by email.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Additional Information</h3>
          <p><strong>Processing Time:</strong> Please allow up to 7 working days after submitting your visa questionnaire for the preparation of your visa application support documents. This timeframe is necessary to ensure the accuracy and compliance of the documents with Japanese immigration requirements.</p>
