Virtual Conference and Extended Deadlines
============

As the submissions are gradually piling up, there has been a lot of discussion behind the scenes regarding *how* to host this conference. While we were hoping that the smaller scope of the conference and the remote location might provide us an opportunity to host a small physical event, given the current global situation, this seems to be inappropriate. Augmented Humans 2022 will therefore be fully virtual.

What does this mean? We will likely make many small adjustments to the planned conference over the next few weeks. We will keep you updated on this. One big change, however, is that nobody needs to make travel arrangements. This means that we gain some extra time in the process leading up to the conference. We will use the newly freed up time to extend the deadline as many authors are working under the constraints of quarantine .

The new timeline will be:
Full Papers Submission Deadline: December 17th
Decisions sent to Author: January 20th
Camera ready: ~ January 27th (will be confirmed with decision)
Conference: February 22nd-24th
